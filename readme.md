# Initializing the database

In this project we choose to use postgres due to our familiarity with this, we are using it on a docker container, to initilize it, go to the root folder, and run

```
sudo docker compose up
```

optionally, you can run the following to run the container on second plan, this way, your terminal will not be locked by docker logs

```
sudo docker compose up -d
```
